This code performs Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), using adegenet 2.0.0 This code finds the most supported number of clusters in the sample group and generates an assignment plot similar to STRUCTURE plots. You will likely have to change the file and folder names and pathways, but can use the GENEPOP file provided as an example.
